This website is using django backend. All you need to do is to go through https://docs.djangoproject.com/ so that you get the basic knowledge that how things are working in django.

## Steps to follow :pencil2::

1. First of all install Django:

```bash
  python -m pip install Django
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucifer1708/prody-2023.git
```

3. Change the directory to prody-2023 using:

```bash
cd prody-2023
```

4. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

6. Now install all the packages which are being used in this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Now run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Alternative:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
and navigate to localhost:8000
